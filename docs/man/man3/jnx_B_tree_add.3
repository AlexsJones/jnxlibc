.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
This function takes a key and a value for the record, creates the appropriate record and inserts it into the tree. If a record with the same key already exists in the tree the function will just replace the value for that record.
.PP 
The key and value are not copied they are just used as pointer assignments, so it's important to think about the lifecycle of keys and values you pass to the function. 
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B tree
The B-tree to which new record is added 

.TP
.B key
The key for the record 

.TP
.B value
The value for the record
