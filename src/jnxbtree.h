 *
 * The B-tree keys are required to follow some order, so with respect to that order
 * the function should return:
 *     - an integer < 0 if first parameter comes before second parameter
 *     - a 0 if first and second parameters are equal
 *     - an integer > 0 if the first parameter comes after the second parameter
 * 
 * Typically, these values can be -1, 0, and 1 respectivelly.

 *
 * @param order The order of the tree, i.e. the minumum number of records held in a

 * @param callback The function that takes to keys as void pointers, and returns an
 *                     integer which represents whether the first key is "before", "equal"
 *                     or "after" the second key according to some key ordering. The function
 *                     returns an integer less than 0 if first key is before second key,
 *                     zero if both keys are equal, and an integer greater than 0 if the

 * and inserts it into the tree. If a record with the same key already exists in the tree
 * the function will just replace the value for that record.

 * @param key The key for the record
 * @param value The value for the record

 * @return Pointer to the value, or NULL if key is not in the tree.

 * the tree is rebalanced if necessary. If the record with @a key
 * is not in the @a tree, the tree is unchanged.

 *                is returned. Set this to NULL if your values are not malloced.
 *
 * @return Pointer to the value from the tree so that users can free potentially malloc'd values.
